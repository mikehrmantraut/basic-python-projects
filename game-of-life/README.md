Conway's Game of Life
--
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life,<br/>
is a cellular automaton devised by the British <br/>
mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.<br/>
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is <br/>
determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.<br/>
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial <br/>
configuration and observing how it evolves.<br/><br/>

Rules:
--
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite,<br/>
two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, <br/>
each of which is in one of two possible states, <br/>
live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). <br/>
Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, <br/>
which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically,<br/>
or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, <br/>
the following transitions occur:<br/>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li><br/>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation..</li><br/>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation..</li><br/>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction..</li><br/>
These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:<br/>

<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives..</li><br/>
<li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell..</li><br/>
<li>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead..</li><br/>
